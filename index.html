  <h1>Everything about </h1>

  <p>I am a software engineer. First, the important stuff:</p>

  <div class="important">
    <h2>Work </h2>

    <p>
      I started my retail career in 2004 by joining the acquisition team of Metro Cash & Carry prior to the opening of its first store in Serbia. By the opening of the first store in Belgrade in January 2005, I've been appointed to a Commissioning Manager where I developed the department for servicing large-order wholesale customers with orders, payments, and transportation solutions.

      By mid 2005, I've been promoted to the Category Manager Assistant of the consumer electronics department. Due to my high performance, by beginning of 2006, I was promoted to the Category Manager, consistently delivering growth in KPIs (revenue, profit, and product rotation). I improved supplier performances, strengthened marketing activities, and introduced seasonal CE promotions. In addition, I developed strong relationships with key customers in all geographical regions of Metro Cash & Carry operations.

      In 2012 I obtained an MBA degree from Hult International Business School in Boston, USA. After graduation, I accepted the Buyer position with French hard-discount retailer, Auchan in Iraq. During engagement, I broadened the range of category management to electrical appliances, stationery, sports equipment, and lighting & fixtures along with the cultural horizons of conducting business and negotiations with Middle Eastern suppliers. Auchan in Iraq is my second country operations opening project where I have been successful in selecting local and international suppliers, creating assortment of 3000 SKUs specific to the local demand, and setting up the purchasing and sales operation processes for the designated product categories.
